      "\n",
      "Animal attacking another animal may cause adrenaline to surge.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because when an animal is threatened, it experiences a fight-or-flight response, which is a physiological reaction that prepares the animal to either fight or flee. This response is triggered by the release of adrenaline, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. The adrenaline surge causes the animal's body to prepare for action, such as increased heart rate, blood flow to the muscles, and heightened senses.\n",
      " The correct choice is E) Store it for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The body stores calories for later use when it is not immediately used for energy. This is because calories are the energy stored in food, and the body needs them to maintain its functions and perform various activities.\n",

      "Insects, being arthropods, have a life cycle with sexual reproduction. This means that they go through a series of stages, including egg, larva, pupa, and adult. During their lifespan, insects reproduce by laying eggs, which hatch into larvae. The larvae then undergo a series of molts, shedding their skin as they grow, until they reach the pupa stage. After a period of time, the pupa transforms into an adult insect, which then mates and lays eggs to continue the cycle.\n",
